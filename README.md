<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Clip2Story is a prototype web application that transcribes news video clips, summarizes transcripts using OpenAI, and feeds summaries as the first draft of a story into a CMS.

This project was originally built for KSAT-TV in San Antonio, Texas. The Associated Press and Stanford University collaborated to develop this application as part of the Local News AI Initiative, funded by the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/ai-for-local-news-advancing-business-sustainability-in-newsrooms/), which aims to leverage AI for the benefit of local news.

The development team thanks the staff at [KSAT-TV](https://www.ksat.com/) and [Graham Media Group](https://www.grahammedia.com/) for proposing this project, and for their participation, feedback, and encouragement.

### Project Objectives

- **Reduce Workloads:** Decreasing the burden for journalists to post new stories on digital platforms.
- **Build New Capabilities:** Allowing journalists to experiment with generating text content from different types of videos.
- **Cost Effectiveness:** Running the system should not incur expenses greater than the savings or revenue gains generated by using it.


### How It Operates

Clip2Story functions through this process:

1. **Video Upload:** The system takes an input of pre-edited video clips uploaded via the web application or via the Trint transcription service.
2. **Transcription:** A transcript of the video is generated via a call to the Trint API.
3. **Approval of Transcript:** After a transcript is completed, the system awaits a journalist to review and/or edit the transcript for accuracy. (The dashboard is seen in the above image.)
4. **Summarization:** The validated transcript is summarized via a call to OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo model via API. (GPT prompts are controlled via the Django Administration interface, see image below.)
5. **Keywording:** Relevant tags for the transcript are generated via a call to OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo model via API.
6. **Publication:** The summary and keywords are uploaded to the Arc XP CMS via API as a draft story for review by a journalist.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To do initial configuration and setting up of third-party apps, prompts, and user accounts; See the [administrators](docs/administrators.md) documentation. 

### Production
This application was originally designed to be hosted on Google Cloud Platform. See [GCP Deployment](docs/gcp_deployment.md) for the details. There is a job running every 30 minutes on Cloud Run that checks for and deletes old videos. See [Management Tasks and Jobs](docs/tasks_and_jobs.md) for details.

### Prerequisites

* Django
* Postgres
* Trint API access
* Arc XP API access
* OpenAI API access
* Google Cloud Platform (for production hosting)


### Installation

Install [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).

Create a local version of the database. For this step, you may need to locate the `createdb` command on your computer. This will vary depending on the version of Postgres.app that you installed.

```sh
# First try plain old createdb

createdb summarizerdb

# If the above doesn't work, try locating the createdb command in
# Postgres.app folder. Below is an example if you're on Postgres.app version 15

/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/15/bin/createdb summarizerdb

```

Grab a copy of the codebase and install Python requirements.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:associatedpress/local-ai-ksat.git
cd local-ai-ksat
pipenv install --dev
```

> NOTE: All of the following commands should be executed
> on the command line, from the top-level `local-ai-ksat/` directory,
> unless otherwise specified.

Set up a `.env` file to store secrets and other project-specific environment variables.

```sh
cp env.template .env
```

Add your database username to the `.env` file:

```sh
echo DJANGO_DB_USER=$(whoami) >> .env
```

Migrate your local database (this will create all tables, fields, etc.).

```sh
# If you haven't already done so, activate the virtual environment
# by running "pipenv shell" from the top-level "local-ai-ksat/" directory

# Then navigate to the clip2story/ directory and update the database
cd clip2story/
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser for the Django admin database

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Any time you install a new application dependency using `pipenv install`, you must regenerate the `requirements.txt` file
> used in the production deployment by running `pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt`. And of course, commit that update along with any code updates in order to make the new software dependencies available in production.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

For day-to-day usage, use the below commands.

> Note, you may also need to occassionally migrate your database,
> per the instructions above in Setup

```sh
# Activate the virtual environment
cd local-ai-ksat/
pipenv shell

# Fire up the dev server
cd clip2story/
python manage.py runserver
```

Use your superuser credentials to log into:

- the app at http://localhost:8000
- Django admin: http://localhost:8000/admin

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

At the end of the MVP development period, these were the features that we thought would be useful to have in the future:

- [ ] Integration with a variety of other transcription services, especially an OpenAI Whisper model because it performed really well in a separate project for Michigan Radio.
- [ ] Integration with a variety of other content management systems
- [ ] Native UI management and help guides that do not use the Django interface
